# Simulation-of-Fast-Ethernet

This project is to simulate the Fast Ethernet. The goal of the project is to practice basic socket AP programming
through a client/server application.
• Fast Ethernet is simulated by multiple processes on multiple machines and each station in the Ethernet is
simulated by a process.
• The switch of the fast Ethernet is also simulated by a process. These processes can run on different workstations
in the Linux lab.
